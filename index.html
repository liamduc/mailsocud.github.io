    <marquee>According to all known laws of aviation,there is no way a bee should be able to fly.Its wings are too small
      to get its fat little body off the ground.The bee,of course,flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think
      is impossible. BARRY BENSON: (Barry is picking out a shirt) Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow,
      black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.JANET BENSON:Barry!Breakfast is ready!BARRY:Cumming!Hard
      on is on.(Barry uses his antenna like a charger) Hello?ADAM FLAYMAN:(Through phone)-Barry?BARRY:-Adam~ADAM:-Can
      you believe this is happening?BARRY:-|can't. I'll pick you up.(Barry flies down the stairs) MARTIN BENSON:Looking
      sharp.JANET:Use the stairs.Your father paid good money for those.BARRY:Sorry.I'm excited. MARTIN: Here's the
      graduate.We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's.JANET:Very proud.(Rubs Barry's hair) BARRY=
      Ma! | got a thing going here. JANET: - You got lint on your fuzz. BARRY: - Ow! That's me!JANET:-Wave to us!We'll
      be in row 118,000. - Bye! (Barry flies out the door) JANET: Barry, | told you, stop flying in the house! (Barry
      drives through the hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a newspaper) BARRY== - Hey, Adam. ADAM: - Hey,
      Barry. (Adam gets in Barry's car)-Is that fuzz gel?BARRY:-A little.Special day,graduation.ADAM:Never thought I'd
      make it. (Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving) BARRY: Three days grade school, three days high
      school... ADAM: Those were awkward. BARRY: Three days college. I'm glad|took a day and hitchhiked around the
      hive.ADAM==You did come back different.(Barry and Adam pass by Artie,who is jogging)
      ARTIE:-Hi,Barry!BARRY:-Artie,growing a mustache?Looks good.ADAM:-Hear about Frankie?BARRY:-You going to the
      funeral?BARRY:-No,I'm not going to his funeral. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a
      squirrel.Such a hothead.ADAM:|guess he could have just gotten out of the way.(The car does a barrel roll on the
      loop-shaped bridge and lands on the highway)|love this incorporating an amusement park into our regular
      day.BARRY:|guess that's why they say we don't need vacations.(Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly
      over the graduating students) Boy,quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances.(Barry and Adam sit down and put
      on their hats)-Well,Adam,today we are men.ADAM:-We are!BARRY=-Bee-men.=ADAM=-Amen!BARRY AND ADAM:Hallelujah!(Barry
      and Adam both have a happy spasm) ANNOUNCER:Students,faculty,distinguished bees,please welcome Dean Buzzwell.DEAN
      BUZZWELL:Welcome,New Hive Oity graduating class of...9!That concludes our ceremonies.And begins your career at
      Honex Industries!ADAM:Will we pick our job today?(Adam and Barry get into a tour bus) BARRY=|heard it's just
      orientation. (Tour buses rise out of the ground and the students are automatically loaded into the buses) TOUR
      GUIDE: Heads up! Here we go. ANNOUNCER: Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. BARRY: - Wonder
      what it'll be like?ADAM:-A little scary.TOUR GUIDE==Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the
      Hexagon Group.Barry:This is it!BARRY AND ADAM:Wow.BARRY:Wow.(The bus drives down a road an on either side are the
      Bee's massive complicated Honey-making machines) TOUR GUIDE: We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole
      life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring
      the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula ig automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and
      bubble-contoured ate this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... EVERYONE ON BUS:
      Honey! (The guide has been collecting honey into a bottle and she throws it into the crowd on the bus and it is
      caught by a girl in the back) ADAM: - That girl was hot. BARRY: - She's my cousin!ADAM==-She is?BARRY:-Yes,we're
      all cousins. ADAM: - Right. You're right.TOUR GUIDE:-At Honex,we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee
      existence.These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.(The bus passes by a Bee wearing a helmet who is
      being smashed into the ground with fly-swatters,newspapers and boots.He lifts a thumbs up but you can hear him
      groan) ADAM==-What do you think he makes?BARRY:-Not enough.TOUR GUIDE:Here we have our latest advancement,the
      Krelman.(They pass by a turning wheel with Bees standing on pegs,who are each wearing a finger-shaped hat)
      Barry:-Wow,What does that do?TOUR GUIDE:-Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us
      millions.ADAM:(Intrigued) Can anyone work on the Krelman?TOUR GUIDE:Of course.Most bee jobs are small ones.But
      bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job
      you pick for the rest of your life.(Everyone claps except for Barry) BARRY:The same job the rest of your
      life?|didn't know that. ADAM: What's the difference?TOUR GUIDE:You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species,
      haven't had one day off in 27 million years.BARRY:(Upset) So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure
      try.(Everyone on the bus laughs except Barry.Barry and Adam are walking back home together) ADAM:Wow!That blew my
      mind!BARRY:"What's the difference?" How can you say that?One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make.
      ADAM: I'm relieved.Now we only have to make one decision in life.BARRY:But,Adam,how could they never have told us
      that?ADAM:Why would you question anything?We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on
      Earth.BARRY:You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?ADAM:Like what?Give me one example.(Barry and
      Adam stop walking and it is revealed to the audience that hundreds of cars are speeding by and narrowly missing
      them in perfect unison) BARRY:|don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.ANNOUNCER:Please clear the
      gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach.BARRY:Wait a second.Check it out.(The Pollen jocks fly in,circle around and
      landing in line)-Hey,those are Pollen Jocks!ADAM:-Wow.I've never seen them this close. BARRY: They know what it's
      like outside the hive.ADAM:Yeah,but some don't come back. GIRL BEES: - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! (The Pollen Jocks
      hook up their backpacks to machines that pump the nectar to trucks, which drive away) LOU LO DUVA: You guys did
      great! You're monsters!You're sky freaks! | love it! (Punching the Pollen Jocks in joy) | love it! ADAM: - |
      wonder where they were. BARRY: - | don't know.Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where,
      doing who knows what. You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock.You have to be bred for that.ADAM==Right.(Barry
      and Adam are covered in some pollen that floated off of the Pollen Jocks) BARRY:Look at that.That's more pollen
      than you and | will see in a lifetime. ADAM: It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of
      it.BARRY:Perhaps.Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. (Barry waves at 2 girls standing a
      little away from them) ADAM== Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?BARRY:Distant.Distant.POLLEN JOCK #1:Look
      at these two.POLLEN JOCK #2:-Couple of Hive Harrys.POLLEN JOCK #1:-Let's have fun with them. GIRL BEE #1: It must
      be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. BARRY: Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my
      throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! (Slaps Adam with his hand to represent his scenario) GIRL BEE #2:
      - Oh, my! BARRY: - | never thought I'd knock him out.GIRL BEE #1:(Looking at Adam) What were you doing during
      this?ADAM:Obviously|was trying to alert the authorities.BARRY:|can autograph that.(The pollen jocks walk up to
      Barry and Adam,they pretend that Barry and Adam really are pollen jocks.) POLLEN JOCK #1:A little gusty out there
